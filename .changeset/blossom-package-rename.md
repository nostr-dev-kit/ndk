BREAKING: Rename package from @nostr-dev-kit/ndk-blossom to @nostr-dev-kit/blossom

This is a breaking change that simplifies the package name to better align with the Blossom protocol naming.

Migration:
- Update imports: `@nostr-dev-kit/ndk-blossom` â†’ `@nostr-dev-kit/blossom`
- All functionality remains the same, only the package name has changed
