# When to ask Gemini

## Mandatory

### Code review

Whenever you finish a task and are ready to report back with your results, **you need to ask Gemini to review your work**.

#### Use natural language and try to be as detailed as possible with your question
cursor-tools repo "Take a look at the work I have done. These are the files: foo, bar, baz, etc. The goal of this work was to achieve XYZ. Please check for bugs or logic gaps, and let me know if I have matched the guidelines and style of the codebase."`

## Recommended

### Implementation plan

If the contents of `./context/CURRENT_PROJECT.md`, `./context/CURRENT_TASK.md`, and the guides in the `./documentation` directory do not provide enough information about your implementation, you should ask     Gemini to help you plan out a solution to your specific issue.

#### Architecture question
`cursor-tools plan "Please help me plan out a way to make personal assistants be able to create bookings etc. on behalf of the therapist they work for."`

#### Stack question
`cursor-tools plan "Please help me plan out step by step the refactor of our email template system from EJS to a more modern framework."`

### Second opinion

Before you start writing a new file with a high level of complexity, you can ask Gemini for a second opinion on your intended course of action before you start.

#### Be very specific about your implementation plan, and use Gemini's extensive codebase knowledge to     your advantage
`cursor-tools repo "I need a second opinion on something. I am about to create a new webhook that captures data from Airtable and syncs it with a user's account. Here is a high level overview of the business logic, 1. x, 2. y, 3. z. I am planning to write this functionality inline in the webhook handler. Does this sound like the best plan, or are there some useful utilities in the codebase that may make this easier?"`
