# Plan to Migrate from pnpm to Bun

## Analysis
- Monorepo using pnpm workspaces
- Uses TypeScript extensively
- Has test setup with Vitest
- Uses ESM modules in most places
- Uses turbo for build orchestration

## Migration Steps

1. Update Root Configuration
- Replace pnpm workspace config with Bun workspace config
- Update package.json to use Bun
- Remove pnpm-specific files

2. Package Manager Migration
- Replace pnpm commands with Bun equivalents
- Update scripts in package.json files
- Update lockfile

3. Build System Updates
- Keep turbo for now as it works well with Bun
- Update tsup configurations if needed
- Ensure ESM compatibility

4. Testing Updates
- Keep Vitest as it's compatible with Bun
- Update test configurations if needed

5. CI/CD Updates
- Update Dockerfile to use Bun
- Update GitHub Actions if present

## Compatibility Notes
- Bun has excellent TypeScript support
- Vitest works well with Bun
- ESM is preferred, but CJS is supported
- Most dependencies should work without changes

## Execution Order
1. Root configuration updates
2. Package manager migration
3. Build system updates
4. Testing updates
5. CI/CD updates
6. Verification and testing
