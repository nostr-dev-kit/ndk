# Signers

All events on the Nostr protocol are signed through a keypair
(described in [NIP-01](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/01.md#events-and-signatures)).

In NDK this is taken care of by the `NDKSigner` interface that can be passed in during initialization or later during
runtime.

## Different Signing Methods

### Browser Extensions

A common way to use NDK is to use a browser extension which is described
in [NIP-07](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/07.md).
This mechanism allows the user to sign events with a browser extension to not share their private key with the
application.

The most used browser extensions are [Nos2x](https://github.com/fiatjaf/nos2x) and [Alby](https://getalby.com/alby-extension).

```ts
// Import the package, NIP-07 signer and NDK event
import NDK, { NDKEvent, NDKNip07Signer } from "@nostr-dev-kit/ndk";

const signer = new NDKNip07Signer();
const ndk = new NDK({ signer });
```

Anytime you call `sign()` or `publish()` on an [NDK Event](/core/docs/fundamentals/events.html) the browser
extension will prompt the user to sign the event.

### Private Key Signer

NDK provides `NDKPrivateKeySigner` for managing in-memory private keys. This is useful for development, testing, or applications that manage keys locally.

> [!WARNING]
> We strongly recommend not using this in production. Requiring users to share their private key is a security
> risk and should be avoided in favor of using [a browser extension](/core/docs/fundamentals/signers.html#browser-extensions) 
> or [a remote signer](/core/docs/fundamentals/signers.html#remote-signer).

The private key signer takes the private key in the `nsec` format.

```ts
import { NDKPrivateKeySigner } from "@nostr-dev-kit/ndk";

// Generate a new private key
const signer = NDKPrivateKeySigner.generate();
console.log("nsec:", signer.nsec);
console.log("npub:", signer.npub);
```

This library can also [help with generating new keys](/core/docs/fundamentals/signers.html#generate-keys).


### Remote Signer

A Nostr remote signer (aka `bunker`) is an application or device that securely stores your private key and signs Nostr
events on your behalf, preventing you from having to expose the private key. It works by establishing a secure
connection (over
Nostr relays), as described in [NIP-46](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/46.md), where the bunker
implementation can approve or deny requests.

To add remote signing support to your application, there are a few things you need:

* a bunker:// connection string provided by the user
* A local (client) keypair used to communicate with
  remote-signer. [Can be generated by NDK](/core/docs/fundamentals/signers.html#generate-keys)

Create a `NDKNip46Signer` with the bunker connection string and local keypair.

<<< @/core/docs/snippets/sign_with_bunker.ts

## Sign Events

Once the signer is initialized, you can use it to sign and [publish](/core/docs/fundamentals/publishing.html) events:

```ts
const event = new NDKEvent(ndk);
event.kind = 1;
event.content = "Hello, world!";
await event.sign(); // [!code focus]
```

## Signer Relays

If the [signer](/core/docs/fundamentals/signers.md) implements the `getRelays()` method,
NDK will use the relays returned by that method as the explicit relays.

```ts
// Import the package
import NDK, {NDKNip07Signer} from "@nostr-dev-kit/ndk";

// Create a new NDK instance with just a signer (provided the signer implements the getRelays() method)
const nip07signer = new NDKNip07Signer();
const ndk = new NDK({signer: nip07signer});
```

## Combining signers

You can specify the use of a different signer to sign with different keys.

> [!TIP]
> If you plan on allowing multiple signers we recommend using [@nostr-dev-kit/sessions](/sessions/README.html).

<<< @/core/docs/snippets/sign_event_with_other_signers.ts

## Read Public key

**Read the user's public key**

```ts
nip07signer.user().then(async (user) => {
    if (!!user.npub) {
        console.log("Permission granted to read their public key:", user.npub);
    }
});
```

## Generate Keys

One good case where weo do want you to use `NDKPrivateKeySigner` is to help you generate keys as the signer
provides helper methods:
