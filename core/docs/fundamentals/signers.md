# Signers

All events on the Nostr protocol are signed through a keypair 
(described in [NIP-01](https://nostr-nips.com/nip-01#events-and-signatures)).

In NDK this is taken care of by the `NDKSigner` interface that can be passed in during initialization or later during
runtime.

## Different Signing Methods

### Browser Extensions

A common way to use NDK is to use a browser extension which is described in [NIP-07](https://nostr-nips.com/nip-07). 
This mechanism allows the user to sign events with a browser extension to not share their private key 
with the application. 

The most used browser extensions are [Nos2x](https://github.com/fiatjaf/nos2x) and [Alby](https://getalby.com/alby-extension).

```ts
// Import the package, NIP-07 signer and NDK event
import NDK, { NDKEvent, NDKNip07Signer } from "@nostr-dev-kit/ndk";

const signer = new NDKNip07Signer();
const ndk = new NDK({ signer });
```

Anytime you call `sign()` or `publish()` on an [NDK Event](/core/docs/fundamentals/events.html) the browser
extension will prompt the user to sign the event.

### Private Key Signer

NDK provides `NDKPrivateKeySigner` for managing in-memory private keys. This is useful for development, testing, or applications that manage keys locally.

> [!WARNING]
> We strongly recommend not using this in production. Requiring users to share their private key is a security
> risk and should be avoided in favor of using [a browser extension](/core/docs/fundamentals/signers.html#browser-extensions) 
> or [a remote signer](/core/docs/fundamentals/signers.html#remote-signer).

The private key signer takes the private key in the `nsec` format.

```ts
import { NDKPrivateKeySigner } from "@nostr-dev-kit/ndk";

// Generate a new private key
const signer = NDKPrivateKeySigner.generate();
console.log("nsec:", signer.nsec);
console.log("npub:", signer.npub);
```

This library can also [help with generating new keys](/core/docs/fundamentals/signers.html#generate-keys).


### Remote Signer

A Nostr remote signer (aka `bunker`) is an application or device that securely stores your private key and signs Nostr
events on
your behalf, preventing you from having to expose the private key. It works by establishing a secure connection (over
Nostr relays)
, as described in [NIP-46](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/46.md), where the bunker implementation
can approve
or deny requests.

To add remote signing support to your application, there are a few things you need:

* a bunker:// connection string provided by the user
* A local (client) keypair used to communicate with
  remote-signer. [Can be generated by NDK](/core/docs/fundamentals/signers.html#generate-keys)

Create a `NDKNip46Signer` with the bunker connection string and local keypair.

```ts
// provided by the user
const signerConnectionString = 'bunker://....';

// local keypair generated when signer if first initialised
const clientKeypair = NDKPrivateKeySigner.generate(); //
const clientNsec = clientKeypair.nsec;

// initiate NIP-46 signer
const signer = NDKNip46Signer.bunker(ndk, signerConnectionString, clientNsec);

// promise will resolve once the `kind:24133` event is received
const user = await signer.blockUntilReady();

console.log("Welcome", user.npub);
```



## Sign Events

Once the signer is initialized, you can use it to sign and [publish](/core/docs/fundamentals/publishing.html) events:

```ts
const ndkEvent = new NDKEvent(ndk);
ndkEvent.kind = 1;
ndkEvent.content = "Hello, world!";
await ndkEvent.sign(); // [!code focus]
```

## Combining signers

You can specify the use of a different signer to sign with different pubkeys.

<<< @/core/docs/snippets/sign_event_with_other_signers.ts

## Read Public key


**Read the user's public key**

```ts
nip07signer.user().then(async (user) => {
    if (!!user.npub) {
        console.log("Permission granted to read their public key:", user.npub);
    }
});
```

## Generate Keys

Perhaps the only time we really want you to use the `NDKPrivateKeySigner` is to help you generate new keys as the signer
provides helper methods to do just that:

```ts
import { NDKPrivateKeySigner } from "@nostr-dev-kit/ndk";

// Generate a new private key
const signer = NDKPrivateKeySigner.generate();
console.log("nsec:", signer.nsec);
console.log("npub:", signer.npub);
```
