     *
     * This is the single place in the codebase that matches

     *
     * This is also what allows for reactivity in NDK apps, such that
     * whenever an active subscription receives an event that some
     * other active subscription would want to receive, both receive it.
     *
     * TODO This also allows for subscriptions that overlap in meaning
     * to be collapsed into one.
     *
     * I.e. if a subscription with filter: kinds: [1], authors: [alice]
     * is created and EOSEs, and then a subsequent subscription with
     * kinds: [1], authors: [alice] is created, once the second subscription
     * EOSEs we can safely close it, increment its refCount and close it,
     * and when the first subscription receives a new event from Alice this
     * code will make the second subscription receive the event even though
     * it has no active subscription on a relay.
     * @param event Raw event received from a relay
     * @param relay Relay that sent the event
     * @param optimisticPublish Whether the event is coming from an optimistic publish
