# Usage

## Instantiate an NDK instance

You can pass an object with several options to a newly created instance of NDK.

-   `explicitRelayUrls` â€“ an array of relay URLs.
-   `signer` - an instance of a [signer](#signers).
-   `cacheAdapter` - an instance of a [Cache Adapter](#caching)
-   `debug` - Debug instance to use for logging. Defaults to `debug("ndk")`.

```ts
// Import the package
import NDK from "@nostr-dev-kit/ndk";

// Create a new NDK instance with explicit relays
const ndk = new NDK({
    explicitRelayUrls: ["wss://a.relay", "wss://another.relay"],
});
```

If the signer implements the `getRelays()` method, NDK will use the relays returned by that method as the explicit relays.

```ts
// Import the package
import NDK, { NDKNip07Signer } from "@nostr-dev-kit/ndk";

// Create a new NDK instance with just a signer (provided the signer implements the getRelays() method)
const nip07signer = new NDKNip07Signer();
const ndk = new NDK({ signer: nip07signer });
```

Note: In normal client use, it's best practice to instantiate NDK as a singleton class. [See more below](#architecture-decisions--suggestions).

## Connecting

After you've instatiated NDK, you need to tell it to connect before you'll be able to interact with any relays.

```ts
// Import the package
import NDK from "@nostr-dev-kit/ndk";

// Create a new NDK instance with explicit relays
const ndk = new NDK({
    explicitRelayUrls: ["wss://a.relay", "wss://another.relay"],
});
// Now connect to specified relays
await ndk.connect();
```

## Architecture decisions & suggestions

-   Users of NDK should instantiate a single NDK instance.
-   That instance tracks state with all relays connected, explicit and otherwise.
-   All relays are tracked in a single pool that handles connection errors/reconnection logic.
-   RelaySets are assembled ad-hoc as needed depending on the queries set, although some RelaySets might be long-lasting, like the `explicitRelayUrls` specified by the user.
-   RelaySets are always a subset of the pool of all available relays.
