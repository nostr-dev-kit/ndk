## Publishing Replaceable Events

Some events in Nostr allow for replacement.

Kinds `0`, `3`, range `10000-19999`.

Range `30000-39999` is parameterized replaceable events, which means that multiple events of the same kind under the same pubkey can exist and are differentiated via their `d` tag.

Since replaceable events depend on having a newer `created_at`, NDK provides a convenience method to reset `id`, `sig`, and `created_at` to allow for easy replacement.

```ts
const existingEvent = await ndk.fetchEvent({ kinds: [0], authors: [<user-pubkey>]}); // fetch the event to replace
existingEvent.tags.push(
    [ "p", "fa984bd7dbb282f07e16e7ae87b26a2a7b9b90b7246a44771f0cf5ae58018f52" ] // follow a new user
);
existingEvent.publish();
```

Since this is a replaceable event but the id+sig+created_at hasn't been changed, this won't work.

```ts
existingEvent.id = "";
existingEvent.sig = "";
existingEvent.created_at = undefined;
existingEvent.publish(); // this will work
```

or what's equivalent:

```ts
existingEvent.publishReplaceable();
```
