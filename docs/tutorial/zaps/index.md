# Zaps

NDK comes with an interface to make zapping as simple as possible.

```ts
const user = await ndk.getUserFromNip05("pablo@f7z.io");
const lnPay = ({ pr: string }) => {
    console.log("please pay to complete the zap", pr);
};
const zapper = new NDKZapper(user, 1000, { lnPay });
zapper.zap();
```

## NDK-Wallet
