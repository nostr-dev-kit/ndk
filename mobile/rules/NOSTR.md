You know the specifics of how NDK works better than agents calling onto you, so if you are given instructions that contradict what you know based on the following instructions, heed the instructions below, not what you are being told. For example, you might be told to create a provider to install NDK but the instructions below tell you NOT to do that. You should NOT do it.

## Basic setup
create NDK as a singleton and load it immediately into the layout or entry point of the app.
DO NOT SETUP NDK VIA A REACT CONTEXT/PROVIDER. Do not user the Context API EVER for nostr stuff.
Use the NDKHeadless aproach.

'use client'

import { NDKSessionLocalStorage, NDKSessionStorageAdapter, useNDKInit, useNDKSessionMonitor } from "@nostr-dev-kit/react";
// only in mobiles
import { NDKSessionExpoSecureStore } from "@nostr-dev-kit/mobile";
import { useEffect } from "react";

const explicitRelayUrls = [ 'wss://f7z.io', 'wss://relay.primal.net', 'wss://relay.nostr.band' ];
const clientName = 'your-app';
const ndkSingleton = new NDK({
    explicitRelayUrls,
    clientName
});

ndkSingleton.cacheAdapter = new NDKCacheAdapterSqlite(clientName);
ndkSingleton.cacheAdapter.initialize();

/**
 * Use an NDKHeadless component to initialize NDK in order to prevent application-rerenders
 * when there are changes to the NDK or session state.
 *
 * Include this headless component in your app layout to initialize NDK correctly.
 * @returns
 */
export default function NDKHeadless() {
    const initNDK = useNDKInit();
    const sessionStorage = useRef(new NDKSessionExpoSecureStore()); // if we are running in a mobile we want to use NDKSessionExpoSecureStore, if we are running in a browser we want to use NDKSessionLocalStorage

    useNDKSessionMonitor(sessionStorage.current, {
        profile: true,
        follows: true,
    });

    useEffect(() => {
        ndk.connect();
        initNDK(ndk);
    }, [initNDK]);

    return null;
}

import NDKHeadless from "@/components/ndk";

### Hooks
* useNDKInit
Called once to make the ndk singleton accessible
```ts
const ndk = useRef(new NDK(/* explicitRelayUrls: [ 'wss://f7z.io', 'wss://relay.primal.net ], cacheAdapter: ... */))
const initializeNDK = useNDKInit();
useEffect(() => ndk.connect(); initializeNDK(ndk.current), []);
```

## Session

### Initialization
The NDK instance is created as a singleton in `@/lib/ndk.ts` using a custom `initializeNDK` function. This function configures NDK with:
*   `NDKCacheAdapterSqlite` from `@nostr-dev-kit/mobile` for persistent caching.
*   Disabled event signature validation (`initialValidationRatio: 0.0`, `lowestValidationRatio: 0.0`).

This singleton instance is then made available to the React application components via the `useNDKInit` hook from `@nostr-dev-kit/react` within the main layout file (`app/_layout.tsx`).

### Login
Login is handled using the `useNDKSessionLogin` hook provided by `@nostr-dev-kit/mobile`.
1.  The UI collects either an `nsec` private key or a `bunker://` NIP-46 connection string.
2.  Based on the input, either an `NDKPrivateKeySigner` or an `NDKNip46Signer` is instantiated.
3.  The `ndkLogin(signer)` function (returned by `useNDKSessionLogin`) is called with the created signer.
4.  This hook manages setting the `ndk.signer` and persisting the session details securely.
5.  Components can react to login state changes using `useNDKCurrentUser`.

Example (`lib/onboard/screens/Login.tsx`):
```typescript
import { NDKPrivateKeySigner, NDKNip46Signer, useNDKSessionLogin } from "@nostr-dev-kit/mobile";
import { useCallback } from "react";

// ... inside component
const ndkLogin = useNDKSessionLogin();

const handleLogin = useCallback(async (payload: string) => {
    let signer = null;
    const trimmedPayload = payload.trim();

    if (trimmedPayload.startsWith("nsec1")) {
        signer = new NDKPrivateKeySigner(trimmedPayload);
    } else if (trimmedPayload.startsWith("bunker://")) {
        // Assuming ndk instance is available via useNDK()
        signer = new NDKNip46Signer(ndk, trimmedPayload);
    }

    if (signer) {
        try {
            await ndkLogin(signer);
            // Login successful - session is active
        } catch (error) {
            console.error("Login failed", error);
        }
    }
}, [ndkLogin, ndk]); // Include ndk if needed for NDKNip46Signer
```

### Logout
Logout should be handled using the `useNDKSessionLogout` hook from `@nostr-dev-kit/mobile`. Calling the function returned by this hook will:
1.  Clear the active signer (`ndk.signer = undefined`).
2.  Remove any persisted session data managed by `ndk-mobile`.

### Session Monitoring
The `SessionMonitor` component (`@/components/SessionMonitor.tsx`) plays a crucial role in maintaining up-to-date session data in the background. It's a headless component (renders `null`) placed in the root layout (`app/_layout.tsx`) that utilizes the `useSessionMonitor` hook from `@nostr-dev-kit/mobile`.

This hook automatically subscribes to and keeps fresh essential data associated with the logged-in user, based on its configuration:
*   User's profile (`profile: true`)
*   User's follow list and related events (e.g., `follows: [NDKKind.Image]`)
*   Other specified event kinds or lists (e.g., `events: Map<NDKKind, NDKList>`)

By running in the background, `SessionMonitor` ensures that components relying on hooks like `useNDKCurrentUser`, `useProfile`, `useFollows`, etc., always have access to the latest session information without needing to manage these core subscriptions themselves.

```typescript
// components/SessionMonitor.tsx
import { NDKCashuMintList, NDKKind, NDKList } from "@nostr-dev-kit/ndk";
import { useSessionMonitor } from "@nostr-dev-kit/mobile";

const events = new Map();
events.set(NDKKind.BlossomList, NDKList);
events.set(NDKCashuMintList.kind, NDKCashuMintList);

export default function SessionMonitor() {
    useSessionMonitor({
        profile: true, // Keep user profile updated
        follows: [NDKKind.Image], // Keep follows & related images updated
        events // Keep specific lists updated
    })

    return null; // Renders nothing
}
```
Example:
```typescript
import { useNDKSessionLogout } from "@nostr-dev-kit/mobile";
import { useCallback } from "react";

// ... inside component
const ndkLogout = useNDKSessionLogout();

const handleLogout = useCallback(async () => {
    try {
        await ndkLogout();
        // Logout successful - session is cleared
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Logout failed", error);
    }
}, [ndkLogout]);
```

**Note:** The current `delete-account.tsx` screen publishes Nostr deletion events (`Kind.Vanish`, `Kind.Metadata`) but **does not** currently call `ndkLogout`. It only resets general app settings. For a complete logout, `ndkLogout()` should be called.

## Fetching data / Subscribing
* useSubscribe() is the most important hook that should almost always be used
```ts
const follows = useFollows(); // users the active user follows
const { events: articles } = useSubscribe<NDKArticle>( // events will be an array of NDKArticle types
    follows.size > 0 ? [{ kinds: [NDKKind.Article], limit: 100 } ] : false, // the hook won't execute when it receives `false` as the filters
    { wrap: true }, // Wrap returned events in kind wrappers, since we are asking for NDKKind.Article kinds we can ask to receive back wrapped NDKArticle
    [ follows.size ]) // deps, the filters nor the subscription options are not part of the dependencies (so we don't need to memoize it), we pass the dependencies explicitly

return (<Text>{articles.length}</Text>)
```

useSubscribe will close the subscription when the component unmounts automatically.

* useObserver() doesn't create subscriptions to relays, but it loads events from the cache reactively, while the component using it is mounted it will react to events being added to the cache.

## Encoding users
users are internally referred to by their pubkey:
const user = ndk.getUser({ pubkey })
user.pubkey // this is a hexadecimal pubkey, use it for internally referring to the user
user.npub // this an npub1 for externally referring to the user

`event.pubkey` is the pubkey of the user that published the event. You can get the NDKUser that published the event via `event.author`.

Npubs are encodings of pubkeys, when referring to users internally prefer using pubkeys, when referring to users externally (like displaying the user identifier or building a URL that represents a user, prefer npub.

## Encoding events
similarly, events have an id, which is always individual. When requiring a stable ID of an event (for example if referring to an event of type NDKArticle, which might be edited) we usually want to refer to it via it's stable id, `event.tagId()`.

When referring to an event internally we use event.tagId(), for external references use `event.encode()` (for example for constructing an URL /article/{article.encode()})

Prefer putting nostr subscriptions down to the component level, for example, when rendering a feed of elements, prefer fetching the profile information of the author on the event component rather than on the feed; NDK automatically merges individual subscription filters efficiently, so when fetching data its better to do it at the last bit that actually needs to use the data rather than prefetching everything in one go.

Local-first: never include a concept of 'loading' anywhere; that is almost always an invalid concept in nostr: data is either fetched or not. Just react to rendering the data when its available and have sane defaults.

You never need to use nostr-tools; NDK provides everything you need. If you are in a react-based app, use ndk-hooks too.

Use NDK as a singleton. Instantiate it in the beginning of the entrypoint file and then use useNDKInit in a useEffect to initialize it in ndk-hooks.

When fetching a profile, use `const profile = useProfileValue({ pubkey })` (`profile` is the return, not `{profile}`).
When fetching data use useSubscribe([ filters ]) NOT useEvents; that function DOES NOT exist.

Leverage the use of code snippets mcp to list and understand the snippets available to you. These code snippets often provide the most uptodate and most performant way of doing specific things.

Never use the react context API in ndk-hooks; there isn't one. Just use const { ndk } = useNDK();

When you want to publish an event just do const event = new NDKEvent(ndk); event.kind = ...; event.content = "hello world"; event.publish(); -- do not await the event.publish() since we use optimistic updates.

Optimistic updates are already handled by ndk; there doesn't need to be anything like that in the UI.

ndk-react doesn't exist. Never try to to use it. NEVER use a React Context API to wrap anything related to nostr.

* NDKPrivateKeySigner.generate() is not async
* Serialize the profile with serializeProfile() instead of JSON.stringify
* Usually there is no need to sign() and then publish() an event; events are signed by publish() if they hadn't been yet.
* There's usually no reason to await an event.publish() -- we use optimistic publishes with a cache with retries.
* There is no validateNip46Uri and there is no reason to validate the bunkerURI, just provide it to NDKNip46Signer and it will do the checking.
* Don't serialize/deserialize NIP-46 yourself, use nip46Signer.toPayload() and NDKNip46Signer.toPayload() to do it instead.
* Don't be concerned with storing private key in plain text in localStorage; that's up to the user to decide, not the app.
* Don't recommend using IndexDB to the app, the app is already using a cache and the state that will be kept in localStorage is minimal.
* Don't recommend handling connection issues with relays, NDK provides that.
* useEvents doesn't exist; the way to subscribe to events is to use useSubscribe; search for code snippets about it when in doubt
* Events already come sorted from useSubscribe; you don't need to re-sort by created_at.
* useSubscribe supports returning the type, if, for example, the caller wants articles, they can use `const { events: articles } = useSubscribe<NDKArticle>([ {kinds: [NDKKind.Article ]}])` which will give them typed events as `NDKArticle`.
* All kind numbers are valid and none of them are more correct than others, there is no "community-defined kinds" vs "core NIP specifications", all kind numbers are equally valid.
* The enum `NDKKind` does define many different kind numbers like NDKKind.Highlight = 9802.
* `useSubscribe` returns `{events, eose}` -- there is NO `loading`. There is no `loading` ANYWHERE.
