2023-06-06 pablof7z <_@f7z.io>

    Breaking change: `NDKEvent#author` method has been modified to a getter, so previous `author()` calls
    need to be updated to `author`.

2023-05-08 pablof7z <_@f7z.io>

    Allow creating a relayset from a URL and explicitly passing a set for event publication.
    (useful for development).

2023-05-04 pablof7z <_@f7z.io>

    Obsolete `subject` as a first-class citizen since that's not the case in nostr.

    Implement NIP-27 mentions.

2023-05-03 pablof7z <_@f7z.io>

    Change NDKPool to emit `connect` when the whole pool is connected instead of on a per-relay
    basis. NDKPool now emits `relay:connect` when a single relay connects as well as a
    `relay:disconnect`.
