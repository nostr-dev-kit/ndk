## Design Philosophy

Constellation reimagines bookmarking as a spatial experience rather than a chronological list. Each bookmark is a star in your personal constellation, with:

- **Visual Weight**: More important domains get larger cards
- **Temporal Flow**: Recent bookmarks appear first but blend naturally
- **Social Discovery**: See bookmarks from across the Nostr network
- **Tag Gravity**: Related bookmarks cluster through shared tags
- **Minimalist Beauty**: Information-dense without visual clutter

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

**Note**: To add bookmarks, you'll need a Nostr browser extension like [Alby](https://getalby.com/) or [nos2x](https://github.com/fiatjaf/nos2x). Click the "Login" button in the header to connect.

## Nostr Spirit

Constellation embodies the Nostr ethos:
- **Decentralized**: No central server, no gatekeepers
- **Interoperable**: Works with any Nostr client
- **Censorship-resistant**: Your bookmarks can't be deleted by others
- **Social**: Discover what others are bookmarking
- **Simple**: Clean protocol, clean implementation
